# gitFileRPGGame
This is just a simple game that I coded using c#.
Important! First thing you must do is push the "LoadGame" button.  After that it should work great.
I do not think I will do any more with this game.  It was a great leaning experiance for me, but because of some beginner mistakes I think 
it will be best to start from scrach and make a new game.
Have fun!
